This procedural terrain generator utilizes the [Diamond-square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) to generate height values which are used to construct a 3D landscape. The terrain can be made more or less mountainous with the **Roughness** selector. Custom colors are chosen based on the height of each point in the terrain.
